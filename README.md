# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A simple Python-based tracker that fetches and displays real-time COVID-19 statistics by country, using live data from a public API.


## 🎯 Project Objectives

- To retrieve and display up-to-date global COVID-19 data.
- To practice working with APIs, JSON, and tabular data using Python.
- To visualize COVID-19 trends (e.g., active cases by country) using basic charts.
- To reinforce foundational skills in data analysis and visualization.


## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) – For fetching data from the API
- [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) – For handling tabular data
- [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) – For data visualization
- [disease.sh API](https://disease.sh/docs/) – Source of real-time COVID-19 data
